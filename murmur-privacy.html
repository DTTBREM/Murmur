  <h1>Murmur Privacy and Data Protection Policy</h1>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>At Murmur, your privacy is a top priority. This policy explains how we collect, use, store, and share your personal data when you interact with our app, and it outlines your rights regarding that data. This notice forms an integral part of our General Service Conditions, with the same definitions applying throughout.</p>

  <h2>2. Definitions</h2>
  <h3>2.1 Intermediate Archiving</h3>
  <p>Refers to the temporary retention of personal data that remains of administrative interest (for example, for legal requirements or disputes) before it is ultimately deleted or anonymized.</p>
  
  <h3>2.2 Recipients</h3>
  <p>Denotes our internal team members and any authorized external partners who access your personal data strictly to provide and support our services.</p>
  
  <h3>2.3 MediaShield</h3>
  <p>Is a built-in feature activated by default in Murmur. It ensures that media messages—such as videos, photos, and audio files—cannot be sent or received without the explicit consent of all conversation partners.</p>
  
  <h3>2.4 Personal Data Regulations</h3>
  <p>Means the applicable laws and directives regarding data processing and privacy protections, including relevant EU standards.</p>
  
  <h2>3. Data Collection and Processing</h2>
  <h3>3.1 Account and Profile Information</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>User Name:</strong> You may choose to display your actual first name or a pseudonym.<br>
    <strong>Gender Identity:</strong> Collected for personalization and app functionality.
  </p>
  <p>These details help us manage your account and deliver the services you expect. Some processing actions may require your consent.</p>
  
  <h3>3.2 User Preferences and Interactions</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Profile Settings &amp; Interests:</strong> This includes language preferences, likes, and other profile choices.<br>
    <strong>MediaShield Enforcement:</strong> In every conversation, the MediaShield feature is active by default. It ensures that no media content (videos, photos, or audios) is exchanged unless both parties provide explicit consent.
  </p>
  <p>This information is used to improve your experience, generate usage statistics, and handle user reports or feedback, based on the necessity of executing our service and, when applicable, your consent.</p>
  
  <h3>3.3 Contact Information</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Phone Numbers and Email Addresses:</strong> Used for account management, handling disputes, supporting transactions, and preventing fraudulent activity.
  </p>
  
  <h3>3.4 Usage Data and Logs</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Connection Details:</strong> This covers information such as IP addresses, device details, and timestamps, collected for security, diagnostics, and to enhance overall service quality.
  </p>
  
  <h3>3.5 Content and Moderation</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> Includes messages, images, or other media shared via Murmur.<br>
    <strong>Moderation Data:</strong> Information gathered to ensure that content complies with our community standards.
  </p>
  <p>Data in this category is retained only as long as needed to support moderation and resolve issues, with access strictly limited to necessary circumstances.</p>
  
  <h3>3.6 Support and Transactional Data</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Transactional Details and Support Communications:</strong> Data related to your interactions with our support and payment systems is processed solely for managing your account and fulfilling our contractual obligations.
  </p>
  
  <h2>4. Data Retention and Storage</h2>
  <h3>4.1 Retention Policy</h3>
  <p>We retain your data only for as long as necessary to provide our services or to comply with legal and operational requirements. Some data, such as temporary logs or user content, may be routinely removed, while other information may be kept longer for verification or legal purposes.</p>
  
  <h3>4.2 Storage Practices</h3>
  <p>All personal data is hosted and managed on trusted platforms, including Google, Firebase, and Amplitude. We implement appropriate security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access or loss.</p>
  
  <h2>5. Data Sharing and Transfers</h2>
  <p>Your personal data is shared strictly on a need-to-know basis:</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Internal Use:</strong> Accessible only to our staff for service administration and support.<br>
    <strong>External Partners:</strong> Shared only with authorized providers that help us deliver the Murmur experience, with data hosted on established platforms.
  </p>
  <p>We do not sell or exchange your information for commercial purposes.</p>
  
  <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>In accordance with applicable data protection laws, you have the right to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access:</strong> Confirm whether your data is processed and request access to it along with details about its processing.</li>
    <li><strong>Rectification:</strong> Request corrections to any inaccurate or incomplete personal data.</li>
    <li><strong>Erasure:</strong> Ask for your data to be deleted when it is no longer necessary or if you withdraw consent.</li>
    <li><strong>Restriction:</strong> Limit the processing of your data under certain conditions.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Portability:</strong> Receive your data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.</li>
    <li><strong>Objection:</strong> Object to the processing of your data based on your personal circumstances.</li>
    <li><strong>Post-Mortem Instructions:</strong> Provide guidance on how your data should be handled after your death, including digital legacy instructions.</li>
