  <h1>End User License Agreement (EULA) for Murmur</h1>
  <p><em>Last Updated: March 14, 2025</em></p>
  <p>By downloading, installing, or using Murmur, you agree to be bound by this End User License Agreement (“Agreement”). If you do not agree with these terms, please do not use the app.</p>

  <h2>1. License Grant</h2>
  <p>Murmur is offered free of charge. Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, Murmur hereby grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the app solely for your personal, non-commercial use. This license does not grant any rights to reverse engineer, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract the source code or proprietary algorithms.</p>

  <h2>2. Ownership</h2>
  <p>All intellectual property rights in and to Murmur, including but not limited to its software, design, content, and any related documentation, are exclusively owned by Murmur. Your use of the app does not convey any rights of ownership.</p>

  <h2>3. Content Moderation</h2>
  <h3>Annex 1: Content Moderation and Enforcement Guidelines</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Content Standards:</strong>
      <p>Users are prohibited from sharing any material that is unlawful, incites hate or violence, depicts minors in explicit contexts, or otherwise poses harm. Content containing extremist imagery or promoting sexual solicitation is strictly forbidden.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Automated Review:</strong>
      <p>An AI-driven system continuously monitors user submissions—such as texts, images, and videos—to detect and block content that violates these guidelines. Although the system employs advanced keyword and image analysis techniques, its accuracy is not guaranteed.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Reporting and Enforcement:</strong>
      <p>Users may report objectionable content. Upon review, Murmur reserves the right to impose sanctions, which can range from warnings to temporary suspensions or permanent bans. Repeated violations may result in escalated actions, including mandatory verification and extended suspensions.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>4. Media Sharing and Privacy</h2>
  <p>Murmur enforces that media sharing (including photos, videos, and audio files) is enabled only with explicit consent from all parties involved. Furthermore, to ensure privacy, the app actively blocks screenshot functionality, preventing users from capturing any content displayed within Murmur.</p>

  <h2>5. Privacy and Data Collection</h2>
  <p>Murmur respects your privacy. Our data practices, including the collection, use, and retention of your information, are detailed in our separate <a href="https://your-privacy-policy-url.com">Privacy Policy</a>. By using the app, you agree to the terms outlined in the Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h2>6. Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>Murmur is provided on an “as is” basis, with no warranties of any kind, either express or implied. Under no circumstances shall Murmur, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, or agents be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages arising out of or in connection with your use of the app.</p>
  <p>In the event of any dispute, the parties agree to resolve such matters exclusively through binding arbitration on an individual basis. Users waive their right to participate in class action lawsuits or to seek resolution in a court of law.</p>

  <h2>7. Termination</h2>
  <p>Murmur reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the app immediately and without prior notice if you breach any terms of this Agreement. Termination does not relieve you of any obligations incurred prior to such action.</p>

  <h2>8. Third-Party Integrations</h2>
  <p>Murmur may incorporate third-party libraries, services, or APIs to enhance functionality. The performance and reliability of these integrations are subject to the terms of the respective third parties. Murmur is not responsible for any issues arising from these components.</p>

  <h2>9. Updates and Modifications</h2>
  <p>Murmur may update or modify this Agreement at any time without prior notice. Your continued use of the app after any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>
